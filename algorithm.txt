Assignment 3 Algorithm

Goal: The goal of this program is to loop through a function that randomly picks whether one of two players will score a basket. If one of the players misses a shot the other player hit, the missing player gains a letter. This will continue until one player spells "HORSE", at which point they are declared the loser.

Input: Y/N at the end of a simulation
Output: Which player - if they hit or miss - the resulting score
        The winner of the match

Requirements:
  - A Player class which stores the score for a player in a character array.
  - A recursive function which creates a random number and uses it to determine a player's shot

Feedback:
  - Print to console for each round the Player, the result of their shot, and the score (if added letter)
  - Looping mechanism to end the program
    - Dictated by the user's 'Y/N' response

Step-by-Step Details:
1. Greets user
2. Chooses a number 0 or 1
3. Pass that number into a function that checks if it's a hit or miss
4. Print that Player's shot
5. Repeat the process for Player 2
6. If one player hits and the other misses, the Player who missed gains a letter (H, O, R, S, E).
7. If both hit or both miss, the round continues with no new letters.
8. Check if the the character array for either player is equal to ['H', 'O', 'R', 'S', 'E']
9. When the above statement occurs, the game ends and it will print which player won
10. Ask if the player wants to repeat the game by asking for a Y/N response
